    "## Introductory Machine Learning: Assignment 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment 6 is due Thursday, November 30 at 11:59pm. Late work will not be accepted as per the course policies (see the Syllabus and Course policies on [Canvas](https://canvas.yale.edu).\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start early so that you have time to get help if you're stuck. The drop-in office hours schedule can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.yale.edu).  You can also post questions or start discussions on [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/9209/discussion/). The problems are broken up into steps that should help you to make steady progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your assignment as a .pdf on Gradescope, and as a .ipynb on Canvas. You can access Gradescope through Canvas on the left-side of the class home page. The problems in each homework assignment are numbered. Note: When submitting on Gradescope, please select the correct pages of your pdf that correspond to each problem. This will allow graders to find your complete solution to each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce the .pdf, please do the following in order to preserve the cell structure of the notebook:  \n",
    "1.  Go to \"File\" at the top-left of your Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "2.  Under \"Download as\", select \"HTML (.html)\"\n",
    "3.  After the .html has downloaded, open it and then select \"File\" and \"Print\" (note you will not actually be printing)\n",
    "4.  From the print window, select the option to save as a .pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics**\n",
    "1. Bayesian inference\n",
    "2. Topic models\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two problems test some of the basics of Bayesian inference. The third problem has you building topic models and using them to fit some linear regressions. The fourth problem asks you to build topic models on the UN data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The assignment looks longer than it really is. We step you through most of the code that you need. But it's still on the long side. Although the assignment is due in three weeks, we encourage you to start early!"

Suppose we roll this die many times and get a collection of $n$ outcomes represented by $X_{1}, X_{2}, ..., X_{n}$.

    "\n",
    "Here we have a dataset of single family houses sold in Connecticut near the beginning of 2021, collected from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/homes/connecticut_rb/). You will build linear models of the price for which each house sold, based on its characteristics given in the real estate listing. Such characteristics include internal square footage, the year it was built, the bedroom count, the bathroom count, and the area of the lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there is also usually a lengthy description written by the real estate agent. Is there any additional information hidden in this description that would help improve the model of the price? This is the question we focus on in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering such a question is difficult because the description is written in natural language with thousands of different words. Here we use topic models as a dimension reduction technique. Specifically, instead of using thousands of possible words, and how many times they show up in each house description, we reduce the words to the topic proportions $\\theta_d$ for each document, obtained by posterior inference. These proportions are combined with the other quantitative variables in a linear model with the logarithm of the house price as the response variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Important note:* At first glance, this problem looks really long. But this is deceiving. \n",
    "After reading in the data, we have you make some plots of the log-transformed variables. \n",
    "After that, you just need to run the code that leads up to training a 10-topic topic model, \n",
    "and fitting a linear model using the resulting topic proportions. After this, you are asked to compare the results to those obtained with a 3-topic model. To do this, you can simply copy the code used for the 10-topic model. After that, the crux of the problem is to analyze, understand, and describe the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acknowledgment: The data were scraped and the analysis was done by [Parker Holzer](https://parkerholzer.github.io/), as he began his search for a new house for his family after beginning a job as a data scientist. Thanks Parker!\n"

assembly we are most appreciative of the activities of the secretarygeneral and share the view he expressed in the report on the work of the organization thatthe united nations needs to demonstrate its capacity to function as guardian of the worlds security a p the united nations emerged from the second world war which was unleashed by fascism and militarism which took advantage of the lack of unity among peaceloving forces and of the negative response of the european nations to the soviet proposals for collective action against the aggressor our people took up arms to defend the goals and principles of international relations which were later enshrined with our participation in the united nations charter the members of the antihitler coalition were fighting not only for their national interests but also to bring freedom and independence to so many enslaved nations we welcome the statements made during the general debate about the inviolability of costwar borders in europefundamental changes have taken place in the world represented in the united nations these changes are most profound and radical and signify the end of the cold war and the dawning of an era of peace and mutual trust the renunciation of propagandist polemics and the initiation of a quest for specific bilateral and multilateral action to resolve existing problems by political means drawing upon the prestige and potential of the united nationsclearly the most important feature of these multi faceted features is the fact that they are not confined to narrow national interests of individual states they are global in scale and thus call for a multilateral approach not only are these changes encouraging but they also call for a correct understanding of where they are leading the world in conditions of freedom of choice and of pluralism of opinions based on the new political thinking these changes also mean that we must further outline joint measures to achieve demilitarisation democratization and the humanization of international contacts and to establish the primacy of law in relations among statesover the past few years we have all had a difficult oath to tread gone are the days when people saw everything in terms of black and whites when everyone believed that he alone was right when socialism was made out to be the enemy rather than a partner in world affairs when suspicion and mistrust repelled mutual tolerance and the natural desire of nations to live in peace and friendship with one another when some would put forward proposals to strengthen peace and develop cooperation while others would reject them and without even attempting to understand them when universal human values were not taken into account without wishing to continue this review of an unhappy past for which there are still those who remain nostalgic even today i would point out that in our detailed often heated and at times disrespectful discussions we after all did succeed in restoring and enriching in united nations resolutions and recommendations the meaning of such key notions as international peace and security disarmament economic development cooperation decolonization social justice human rights and so forthbut it is too early to rest on our laurels all this should be embodied in mandatory international legal instruments in this context the next decade which  will mark the end of the twentieth century and of the second millennium will be decisive in terms of whether mankind succeeds in coping with new challenges and whether it will emerge victorious in the struggle for peace and wellbeing for everyone on this planetwe are preoccupied with the problems of eliminating the threat of war bringing about disarmament resolving regional conflicts eliminating the vestiges of colonialism ensuring development social progress observance of human rights and the preservation of an ecological balance it is being increasingly recognized that these problems have a direct bearing on the level of security and the quality of life of the peoples of the worldit would appear that today everyone understands that the use of military force particularly nuclear force with all its devastating consequences has run its course it is also clear that there can be no just settlement of regional conflicts through the use of military force the new level of this understanding has led to important conceptual breakthroughs that have made it possible to conclude and implement the first ever agreement on the actual elimination of a portion of nuclear arsenals of soviet and united states medium and shorterrange missiles it has also made possible the holding of substantive talks on a  per cent reduction in united states and soviet strategic offensive weapons the initiation of the vienna talks on reductions in armed forces and'"
